# Core Principles: **Less is More**

- **Keep implementations small** - *Write the smallest, most obvious solution*
- **Let code speak** - *If you need multi-paragraph comments, refactor until intent is obvious*
- **Simple > Clever** - *Clear code beats clever code every time*
- **Delete ruthlessly** - *Remove anything that doesn't add clear value*
